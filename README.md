## Problem Statement
AHG has been experiencing a shift in the market place towards digital which is possibly leading to decline in its’s store sales – Is this true and can it be proven with data?
AHG is also experiencing a decline in it’s store sales as a result of change in customer demographics - Is this true and can it be proven with data?
Identify the products and regions that are performing badly against the market or when benchmarked against manufacturers of similar products
Identify most profitable products, regions, sales channel and customer demography
If products where to be shelved in the stores, or advertised online, what products may be shelved together given that these products are historically purchased together. Association analysis?
What should AHG Digital strategy be? Should it close its stores(it doesn’t have a store, only resellers, which resellers have low impact- can we move end terms with them?) and migrate fully online across all regions, some regions(some resellers based on regions)? If some, which regions should be migrated fully online, and what is the likely impact of this aggressive strategy (cost benefit analysis – volume and revenue)?
